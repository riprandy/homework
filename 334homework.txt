hi. im back again. 336 homework failed miserably and i have nothing.. to say. 
i was stuck at how to put numbers in the memory - well i wasn't really stuck but i didn't understand how could
i just put numbers randomly in the memory. i thpught it was stupid
but still i had some problems with waits and the whole logic. anyways. i felt really bad tho. like idk it was rreally bad. 



but anyways i have 8 days i guess. now ill work on this homework and finish it as soon as possible since
i have another homework due on the same day. 

lets go. 

mistakes i did in that homework- 
being stuck and not trying things
not asking assistants
not asking help from chat. please use it. i know its fun sometimes to do it on your own but you have to finish this homework anyways .


========================================================================================================================================

first lets read the text

IPC = interprocess communication 

if entire grid is filled but no streak = draw 
row column diagonal 
real time not ordered 

stdin will read the game config 
bidirectional pipes to build communication between players 
okay here's what it says 



• Reading the game configuration (grid size, streak size, player details) from stdin. okay i get this 
• Creating bidirectional pipes to communicate with each player process.---> ask chat
• Forking and executing each player process, redirecting their stdin and stdout to these pipes  -->ask chat

Managing messages from players:
– START: Indicates a player has begun execution; the server should respond with the current
game state.
– MARK: Sent when a player attempts to mark a specific point on the grid. The server checks
if the move is valid and updates the game state accordingly.
• Determining when a player has won by achieving the streak size or when the game ends in a draw,
and notifying all players.

• Reaping child processes to avoid zombies. i kinda know this one but why do i create child processes 



okay so in the message part i forgot about typedef and Enum so i dont want that to happen again

typedef- defines type 

typedef Int int 

typedef struct Mystruct{} person ; you can use it as -> person x rather than struct mystruct = .. 


==================================================================================================


so I did the input taking part, and then I tried to run it but there were some problems
with the compilation 
so I then checked online 
- permission denied error = the same program is running in the background. check the task manager and remove them 
- then i installed wsl and now I can give my program inputs but it gives segmentation fault.

now I am trying to see what the problem is so I debug but I dont know how to use debugger
with a file input. So ill search up that. ILL CHECK ON THAT LATER I HAVE 2 HOMEWORKS AND THE 336 HOMEWORK DEADLINE EXTENDED I STILL HAVE CHANCE. 

in cpp io is buffered and if you dont put endl it wont flush the output buffer immediately after the line
another thing - debugger forces the flush maybe idk chat said taht 
- 

okay when i try to open using remote wsl with a previous folder that i used on windows it switches back to windows

finally. i am using wsl and git together because idk how to use local files or carry them to my local computer but its better this way.
